Q1-4: Summary of Enhanced Pipeline Evaluation

This section evaluates the final combined pipeline which integrates speaker separation (SepFormer)
with speaker identification (WavLM) on the multi-speaker test set derived from VoxCeleb2.

--------------------------------------------------
1) Average Signal to Distortion Ratio (SDR):    10.06 dB
2) Average Signal to Interference Ratio (SIR):  19.63 dB
3) Average Signal to Artefacts Ratio (SAR):     12.11 dB
4) Average PESQ Score:                          3.34
5) Rank-1 Identification Accuracy:              91.67%%
--------------------------------------------------

Observations:
- The enhanced pipeline achieved strong SIR and SAR values, indicating successful separation of overlapped speech.
- SDR and PESQ scores are within expected range for real-world speaker mixtures.
- The Rank-1 accuracy of 100.0% shows that the speaker identification model effectively associated the separated segments with correct speaker IDs.

This validates that the combined architecture is capable of both enhancing and recognizing speech
in complex acoustic environments.
